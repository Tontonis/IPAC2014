\begin{abstract}
The LHC injection kicker magnets experienced significant beam induced heating of the ferrite yoke, with high intensity beam circulating for many hours, during operation of the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The causes of this beam coupling impedance were studied in depth and an improved beam screen implemented to reduce the impedance. Results of measurements and simulations of the new beam screen design are presented in this paper: these are used to predict power loss and temperature of the ferrite yoke for operation after long shutdown 1 and for proposed HL-LHC operational parameters.

\section{Introduction}

During the 2011 and 2012 runs of the LHC, high temperatures were observed in several devices in the LHC  \cite{metral_cham2012}, a critical piece being the LHC injection kicker magnets (MKIs) Fig.~\ref{fig:mkiStruct}, which were attributed to beam-induced heating due to high power loss from the interaction of the circulating beam with the longitudinal beam coupling impedance. This heating was observed to raise the temperature of the ferrite yoke of one of the MKIs above its Curie point during fills, thereby necessitating waiting times of several hours for the ferrite to cool before safe injection could be carried out \cite{mki-heating}. A magnet with an improved beam screen was inserted during technical stop 3 (TS3) (23/09/12-27/09/12), replacing the MKI8D which was measured to have the highest temperature \cite{mki-heatingTemp}; the replacement magnet was subsequently measured to have the lowest temperature of all magnets.

Building on this success a new design has been proposed to satisfy competing needs of low rates of electrical breakdown during magnet pulsing and a low beam coupling impedance to reduce the power lost into the structure by wakefields; in addition to meeting strict requirements for magnet operation for field rise time and flat top stability \cite{mkiUpgrade}.

\section{New Beam Screen Design}

The new design involves a redesign of the capacitively coupled end of the beam screen, intended to reduce the electrical field due to the induced potentials on the screen conductors during magnet pulsing. This reduced electric field reduces the possibility of surface breakdown on the internal face of the beam screen allowing additional beam screens to be inserted where previously they had been removed due to being located in regions of high electric field Fig.~\ref{fig:beamScreenCross} providing complete screening of the ferrite yoke of the magnet. See \cite{mki-ElecBreakdown} for more information on behaviour relating to surface flashover.

\section{Impedance Measurements}

In order to observe the effect of manufacutring tolerences between magnets and as part of the campaign to characterise the impedance of all devices placed into the LHC each of the MKIs with the new beam screen has it's longitudinal beam coupling impedance measured
